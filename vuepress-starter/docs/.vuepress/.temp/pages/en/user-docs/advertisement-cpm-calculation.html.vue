*this screen shows that 76 thousand users updated their apps immediately on day one, only half of the people update so quickly, so the real number is 150k users approximately</p>
<p>STEP 4.
Calculate CPM
Every boost ad runs for 3 hours. So, we divide total monthly visits by 30 days and by 8 to get 3 hour intervals
Total monthly visits = 8.4 million
Total daily visits = 28,000
English feed has 10% of all visitors
Total visits in 3 hour interval = 28,000/8= 3500
Average cost of ad is $1
CPM = $. 28
28 cents on average is a very low CPM</p>
