*this screen shows that 76 thousand users updated their apps immediately on day one, only half of the people update so quickly, so the real number is 150k users approximately

STEP 4.
Calculate CPM
Every boost ad runs for 3 hours. So, we divide total monthly visits by 30 days and by 8 to get 3 hour intervals
Total monthly visits = 8.4 million
Total daily visits = 28,000
English feed has 10% of all visitors
Total visits in 3 hour interval = 28,000/8= 3500
Average cost of ad is $1
CPM = $. 28
28 cents on average is a very low CPM
